# adventure-game
A CLI, text-heavy adventure game with ASCII visuals.
This is still a work in progress, and may have bugs.

## Objective
The objective of the game is somewhat linear, where you are teleported into a cybernetic world and go through many different locations, befriending a cat, and meeting a knight, trying to save a girl from a monster named Skeith.
## Win conditions
This game has 2 endings. You must get the good ending to beat the game (could have gotten other factors to win rather than making one choice :p).

## Known Bugs
- SwordPickup (line 264) does not do anything no matter what you decide on.

## Other Documentation
- I could have gotten the Item class to bring some kind of function like holding in boolean values at least. Despite being part of the repo, it's actually not really used.
- There's many other things I can improve on, from asthetics to probably overhauling the whole thing, which I might do on my free time.

Here is the UML Diagram:
